          <q>During my study at EWU, I have participated in many interesting and valuable classes. One class that sticks out to me is DESN 275, Spring Quarter, 2019 with Dr. Braukmann. In this class I furthered my knowledge in sound design by studying and practicing track mixing, foley sound effects, voice recording, etc. For me, this class was special for it furthered an already existing interest in sound design. I have had the pleasure of working with my alma mater high schoolâ€™s marching band in both teaching the Front Ensemble and running the sound equipment. This sound design class taught by Dr. Braukmann expanded my knowledge and allows me to run sound equipment more efficiently.</q>  
          <q id="secondQ">Another class that I hold with high regards is DESN 243, Fall Quarter, 2019 with Mindy Breen. This typography class opened my designer eyes to both a macro and micro world that I fell in love with. I loved learning the fundamental rules of type and applying them to my works. By understanding the foundation of typography I am able to design books, zines, and posters in a professionally designed manner and then break the rules to achieve meaningful designs.</q>
