    content="As a graphic designer, I seek to offer my skills to create content that is structured in the history of good design while tailored to be unique and specific to each project. In working on new projects with new teams, I will further refine and develop skills in graphic design, print design, sound design, and teamwork. After building a vast repertoire, I will seek a Master of Fine Arts degree to make a career in teaching. If you are looking for a designer who is knowledgable, detail-oriented, and a team player look no further.">

          <p>Xants is a typeface that was produced by Adobe as a part of their Lost Typography of the Bauhaus Masters
            project. This project was aimed at celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus – a German school of
            design and art during the mid 1900s. Modern designers were tasked with revitalizing unfinished fonts from
            Bauhaus designers. The original designer was Xanti Schawinsky. Mr. Schawinsky was a Swiss artist and
            designer, who taught at the Bauhaus. Mr. Schawinsky’s sketches were further worked upon by modern designer
            Luca Pellegrini. Mr. Pellegrini finalized this modern font by adding symbols and punctuations.</p>
          <p>In further celebration of the Bauhaus’ legacy, various academic departments from Eastern Washington
            University tasked students with creating content that emulated Bauhaus principles. The poster displayed,
            uses one of the fonts from Adobe’s project and the principle of basic geometric shapes to honor the Bauhaus.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">Xants (poster) was created by Tannor Glumbik, Jose Arciga, Anthony Riojas, and Payton White.

            layers. Custom brushes were used to create unique tools for the etching process. The end result is an

            <h5 class="italic">Eastern Washington University – Summa Cum Laude </h5>

            <p>As a graduate of Eastern Washington University, I hold a Bachelor of Design – in <span
                class="bold">Design and Business
                Administration</span>. I studied the history of graphic design, Adobe Creative Cloud, photography, web
              design,
              and sound design. My work is heavily influenced by the bold, simplistic, and geometric properties of Art
              Deco, Bauhaus, and the Swiss International Style. You will also find that the majority of my work is
              designed for print, for I find the medium of print to be superior to digital. While digital content may
              reach a larger audience with greater speed, a physically printed work of design carries qualities of smell
              / touch and interacts with the surrounding environment’s lighting in a way that digital content cannot.
              From my education, I have developed a personal design style which exceeds the needs of each project.</p>

              the Spokane Scholars’ award. These students display strong dedication and accomplishments in their
              subject. I was Mt. Spokane High School’s (MSHS) representative for the Fine Arts discipline.</p>

              and MSHS Wind Ensemble. A marimba duet consisting of myself and Devin Petersen inspired the announcer to
              introduce the us as the “Hot Marimba Players” during the awards ceromony</p>

            <p>As an Associate at The UPS Store, I utilize my graphic design background to offer printing solutions. On
              several print projects, I act as a Print Consultant to identify the scope of a customer’s printing needs.
              After collecting the project’s requirements and any assets, I submit the project to our franchisee’s
              printing company – Busy Beaver Graphics in Sandpoint, ID. I also design content for several print projects
              including marketing mailers, calendars, lanyards, album covers, and bookmarks. In working for The UPS
              Store I have developed and refined skills in customer service and print / graphic design.</p>

          <p>In the Spring of 2021, I had the great pleasure of holding an internship with Market Vision Advertising. As
            a Graphic Design Intern, I designed marketing content including logos, social media posts, and storyboards
            for 10+ clients. I created social media campaigns monthly for clients such as Walker’s Furniture & Mattress,
            MÜV Fitness, JR Furniture & Mattress, and Arctic Spas. After designing each campaign, I scheduled the
            content in Hootsuite to post on specific days at specific times. I also posted the content directly to
            clients’ Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. I am very thankful for the client experience gained
            through this internship.

          <p>Working as a Percussion Instructor & Sound Engineer with the Mt. Spokane High School Marching Band (MSMB),
            I taught percussion, piano, and electronic instruments to 12–16 high school students. Each marching season,
            one or two special education students were a part of the Front Ensemble. It was a joy to lead those students
            and see them flourish. During competitions, performances, and overnight trips, I supervised student
            behavior. I also organized and lead 15+ parent volunteers to set-up and tear-down equipment. It was a honor
            to work alongside the staff and students of Mt. Spokane High School</p>

          <p>Working as a Peer Advisor in Eastern Washington University’s (EWU) Financial Aid & Scholarship office, I
            received training relating to confidentiality (FERPA), federal / state grants and loans, and scholarships.
            Using that training and EWU’s data management program – Banner INB, I advised students and parents on their
            financial aid applications, missing paperwork, grants, scholarships, and loans via phone calls, emails, and
            the front office. Working in EWU’s Financial Aid & Scholarship office provided quality experience in
