              <p>Anyone can take a photo. If you are lucky it will have strong composition, but through understanding the above aspects of a photograph's composition, you can better target / select your subject. By knowing how to emphasize or deemphasize your subject you can create a more dynamic, photographic composition.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The following are five terms relevant to photography. The aperture is like the iris of the camera / lens. The size of the opening determines both how much light reaches the sensor and the depth of field of the image. A smaller opening will result in less light and a wider depth of field. The opposite is true. The shutter is like the eye lid. A faster shutter speed will result in less light and an image that freezes time. A slower shutter speed will do the opposite. The ISO is like the nervous system in the back of the eye. I high ISO is more sensitive to light, and thus amplifies the signal more. A high ISO may also result in a grainy texture. Depth of field is like your vision. How clear are you able to see? Is all of the picture in focus, or is part of the image in focus? Lastly, dynamic range refers to the spectrum of light. What tonal and / or hue qualities are present. Is there a large range of values or a small range? To recap, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, depth of field, and dynamic range are five basic qualities of a photograph.</p>

            <p>At the heart, what really makes a photograph a photograph. Do not look to this article for the answer, for I do not know. Though, I will attempt to convey a perspective on photography. A perspective that either will expand your knowledge or be forgotten instantaneously. Let’s give it a go.</p>
            <p>Paintings are constructed; photos are taken (“The Photographers Eye”), and contemporary art can be used as a form to cheat death (“the Ontology of the Photographic Image”).</p>
            <img srcset="img/PocketWatch1.jpg 1031w, img/PocketWatch2.jpg 2062w, img/PocketWatch3.jpg 3093w" src="img/PocketWatch1.jpg" alt="A digital scan of a gold pocket watch from the late 1900s">
            <p>No matter how you describe the above – whether it be photo, image, picture, or etc. – it truly is a digital scan of a pocket watch. Is this scan worthy of being a photograph? At the mechanical level, a scanner is very similar to a digital camera. A electronic sensor reads the light coming in and creates a composition of colored dots. Does this make a scanner a camera and a camera a scanner?</p>
            <p>The pocket watch used – to those who recognize it – is much more than any old watch. It belonged to my great-grandmother: Ruby Renggli. After she died, I kept onto this pocket watch as a memento. For me, this image is not just an image of a watch, this is an image to which many memories are associated with. Does this memento preserved in a digital form cheat death?</p>
            <p>After all of the digging deep and thinking critically, we are still left with “What makes a photo a photo?” To me a photo preserves a moment, a memory to be relieved at a later time. The means of capturing this moment is through a process that is practically instantaneously. Will you call this scanned pocket watched a photo?</p>
