            <p>The following content are summaries of chapters 1–3 from “Light Science & Magic”.</p>

            <p>While a photographer does not have to pay attention to light to capture a decent image, using lighting as your ally will lesson your burden of post-editing. The size and way that light is reflected will also pose different environments. If you pay attention to the lighting – whether artificial and / or natural – you can achieve great photography with minimal equipment.</p>

            <p>At a scientifical level, light is an electromagnetic radiation that is transmitted as protons. All light travels at the same speed, but the electromagnetic field of each proton changes how we perceive the light – that is if the light is within the visible light spectrum. Even though it is common to remember visible light as ROYGBIV, violet light has more energy than red. Warm light will be light at a lower temperature, and cool light will be light at a higher temperature. When it comes to taking a photograph, it is better to have an image that is overexposed, for it is easier to dial back light in post-production than vis versa.</p>

            <p>In regard to how light is reflected, there are a few situations to be aware of. A reflection that is diffused will reflect light equally regardless of the cameras position. If you need to decrease the amount of light on the subject you can distance the light source from the subject, or you can distance the camera from the subject. A direct, light reflection will display the light to only one point-of-view. All other angles will either be very low lit or not at all. Understanding how light is reflecting will change your approach to physically placing the light source or camera.</p>

            <p>At present, this digital photography class has focused my attention on light. From previous design classes I have learned to create contrast that can be assessable, but this class has expanded that thought process. Now I see a composition and dissect the highlights from the whites and the shadows from the blacks. With every photographic shot I have taken thus far, I strive to create a composition that creates hierarchy, focus, and movement through light: or the absence of light). With the regards to color, color has an inherent lightness / darkness. These properties of color also needs to be taken into account when composing and post-editing. In other areas of design, I have had enough practice to develop a design style, but with photography I am too new to define my own style. Therefore, I will continue to learn the basics and focus on working with the basics.</p>

            <h3>Summary: “In Plato’s Cave”</h3>

            <p>From “In Plato’s Cave” Susan Sontag – writer, philosopher, etc. – argues that the photograph does not relay reality as concretely as society holds them to be. A strong comparison to Plato’s Cave philosophy is drawn to further this argument:  humans experience reality within a cave and see reality as shadows projected on the cave. To begin, a photograph is only a selection of the current environment. A photograph is bound by its edges, and beyond these edges are additional information that may or may not change to reality we are viewing. Even if this photo conveys the mood of the subject correctly, the viewer can never fully understand how the image interacts with the subject’s daily life.</p>

            <p>The photograph has also taken an authoritative role in society. The photograph is fact in courts; the photograph is proof in science; and the photograph is knowledge to people. Humans collect and hold onto photos as a way to remember the past and learn new realities. We view the photo as a collectable to collect and trade. The photograph allows us to easily reproduce and share these realities. Susan Sontag argues that the photo cannot give a clear reality without supplemental content. Altogether, the photograph is noted to be addictive form of viewing reality but should be not taken for granted.</p>

            <p>The following are five terms relevant to photography. The aperture is like the iris of the camera / lens. The size of the opening determines both how much light reaches the sensor and the depth of field of the image. A smaller opening will result in less light and a wider depth of field. The opposite is true. The shutter is like the eye lid. A faster shutter speed will result in less light and an image that freezes time. A slower shutter speed will do the opposite. The ISO is like the nervous system in the back of the eye. I high ISO is more sensitive to light, and thus amplifies the signal more. A high ISO may also result in a grainy texture. Depth of field is like your vision. How clear are you able to see? Is all of the picture in focus, or is part of the image in focus? Lastly, dynamic range refers to the spectrum of light. What tonal and / or hue qualities are present. Is there a large range of values or a small range? To recap, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, depth of field, and dynamic range are five basic qualities of a photograph.</p>

            <p>At the heart, what really makes a photograph a photograph. Do not look to this article for the answer, for I do not know. Though, I will attempt to convey a perspective on photography. A perspective that either will expand your knowledge or be forgotten instantaneously. Let’s give it a go.</p>
            <p>Paintings are constructed; photos are taken (“The Photographers Eye”), and contemporary art can be used as a form to cheat death (“the Ontology of the Photographic Image”).</p>
            <img srcset="img/PocketWatch1.jpg 1031w, img/PocketWatch2.jpg 2062w, img/PocketWatch3.jpg 3093w" src="img/PocketWatch1.jpg" alt="A digital scan of a gold pocket watch from the late 1900s">
            <p>No matter how you describe the above – whether it be photo, image, picture, or etc. – it truly is a digital scan of a pocket watch. Is this scan worthy of being a photograph? At the mechanical level, a scanner is very similar to a digital camera. A electronic sensor reads the light coming in and creates a composition of colored dots. Does this make a scanner a camera and a camera a scanner?</p>
            <p>The pocket watch used – to those who recognize it – is much more than any old watch. It belonged to my great-grandmother: Ruby Renggli. After she died, I kept onto this pocket watch as a memento. For me, this image is not just an image of a watch, this is an image to which many memories are associated with. Does this memento preserved in a digital form cheat death?</p>
            <p>After all of the digging deep and thinking critically, we are still left with “What makes a photo a photo?” To me a photo preserves a moment, a memory to be relieved at a later time. The means of capturing this moment is through a process that is practically instantaneously. Will you call this scanned pocket watched a photo?</p>
